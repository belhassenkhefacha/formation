            <p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Actually, that's still true. I can explain. It's very valuable.</p>
            <p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! So, how 'bout them Knicks? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! <strong> Bender!</strong> <em> Ship!</em> Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
            <h2>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</h2>
            <p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. What are their names? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</li><li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li><li>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</li>

            <h3>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</h3>
            <p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li><li>The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</li><li>Shut up and take my money!</li>

            <p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
            <p>I wish! It's a nickel. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Fatal. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I had more, but you go ahead. A true inspiration for the children.</p>
            <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Daylight and everything.</p>
            <p>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Meh. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p>
            <p>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p>
            <p>So, how 'bout them Knicks? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Professor, make a woman out of me. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
            <p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Shut up and get to the point! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
            <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Moving along…</p>
            <p>But I've never been to the moon! Who are you, my warranty?! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Ask her how her day was.</p>
            <p>Belligerent and numerous. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
            <p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. One hundred dollars. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
